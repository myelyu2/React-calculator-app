<h1>React calculator app</h1>

<h3>Intro</h3> I decided to do this project because I thought I needed to showcase the way I do development projects on something as simple as calculator app. The calculator will have simple functions like add, subtract, divide and multiply, with a simple design (because I like simplicity). The process of developing the app will consist of planning, designing, and developing. So, lets begin. </br>

<h3>PLANNING</h3>
First, as I said we need to plan the project and identify all (or the most important) the features it needs to have. As I said, the calculator will not be fancy, with just simple math functions. In addition, the user must be able to clear the input/output and copy the result from display. So, in general, the main features are:</br>

1. Have all numbers from 0 to 9;</br>
2. Add, subtract, divide, multiply;</br>
3. Clear input/output;</br>
4. Copy result to the clipboard;</br>

<h3>DESIGNING</h3>
Considering all the features listed above, based on my experience, it will be easy to develop an app if we have a wireframe/layout of the app we want to build first. So, we head on to Figma, create new project and add all the buttons based on the features.</br>

One of the design patterns is user familiarity with the system. I am not inventing a new generation calculator, so it must have the same layout of buttons as the regular ones. It is important to keep all buttons on the same positions for the Userâ€™s comfort.</br>

Now, it looks like a simple calculator. We also identify the color palette for the project in advance because it will be easier to code it afterwards.</br>
