<h3>Intro </h3>
I decided to do this project because I thought I needed to showcase the way I do development projects on something as simple as calculator app. The calculator will have simple functions basic add, subtract, divide, multiply and calculate a percentage, with a simple design (because I like simplicity). The process of developing the app will consist of planning, designing, and developing. So, lets begin.


<h3>Planning </h3>
First, as I said we need to plan the project and identify all (or the most important) the features it needs to have. As I said, the calculator will not be fancy, with just simple math functions. In addition, the user must be able to clear the input/output and copy the result from display. So, in general, the main features are:
1.	Have all numbers from 0 to 9;
2.	Add, subtract, divide, multiply, percentage, +/- and decimal point;
3.	Clear input/output;

<h3>Designing </h3>
Considering all the features listed above, based on my experience, it will be easy to develop an app if we have a wireframe/layout of the app we want to build first. So, we head on to Figma, create new project and add all the buttons based on the features. 

<i>One of the design patterns is user familiarity with the system. I am not inventing a new generation calculator, so it must have the same layout of buttons as the regular ones. It is important to keep all buttons on the same positions for the Userâ€™s comfort.</i>

We also identify the color palette for the project in advance because it will be easier to code it afterwards.
