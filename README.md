# React calculator app

1.	Intro
I decided to do this project because I thought I needed to showcase the way I do development projects on something as simple as calculator app. The calculator will have simple functions like add, subtract, divide and multiply, with a simple design (because I like simplicity). The process of developing the app will consist of planning, designing, and developing. So, lets begin. </br>

#PLANNING
First, as I said we need to plan the project and identify all (or the most important) the features it needs to have. As I said, the calculator will not be fancy, with just simple math functions. In addition, the user must be able to clear the input/output and copy the result from display. So, in general, the main features are:
1.	Have all numbers from 0 to 9;
2.	Add, subtract, divide, multiply;
3.	Clear input/output;
4.	Copy result to the clipboard;</br>

#DESIGNING
Considering all the features listed above, based on my experience, it will be easy to develop an app if we have a wireframe/layout of the app we want to build first. So, we head on to Figma, create new project and add all the buttons based on the features. 

One of the design patterns is user familiarity with the system. I am not inventing a new generation calculator, so it must have the same layout of buttons as the regular ones. It is important to keep all buttons on the same positions for the Userâ€™s comfort.

Now, it looks like a simple calculator. We also indicate that the result will be copied if we hover and click on the display.

We also identify the color palette for the project in advance because it will be easier to code it afterwards.
